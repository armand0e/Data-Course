    "Your department will be receiving data obtained from scanned documents which have been processed through some OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. The software clearly has some issues – the capitalisation and spacing in the resulting text is inconsistent. Occasionally, it puts semi-colons between sentences where their use is not appropriate. You must write a piece of code which corrects the format of this text, according to the following rules:\n",
    "> * Sentences must start with a capital letter.\n",
    "> * Sentences must be separated by two spaces.\n",
    "> * Commas must be followed by a single space.\n",
    "> * Semi-colons must be replaced with full stops.\n",
    "> * Duplicate punctuation must be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you produce will eventually form part of a data cleaning library, so you should make proper use of functions to carry out the above processes. For testing purposes, a text sample is hard-coded in your application in the data variable. Any programmatical solution in Python may be utilised.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: You will need to write a lookup list into your code so that you can check for proper names and ensure that they are capitalised appropriately.*"
